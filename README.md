Rock vs Mine Prediction
This project aims to classify objects as either "Rock" or "Mine" using sonar data. The dataset consists of 60 features representing the intensity of sonar returns at different angles, and the label indicates whether the object is a rock or a mine.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
sh
Copy code
cd Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction
Install the required packages:
sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the model, you can either run the Jupyter notebook provided or use the Python script to make predictions. Here's an example of how to use the predictive system:

Open the Jupyter notebook Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb.
Run all the cells sequentially.
You can modify the input_data variable in the "Making a Predictive System" section to test different data points.
Alternatively, you can use the following script to predict:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import joblib

# Load the model
model = joblib.load('logistic_regression_model.pkl')

# Example input data
input_data = (0.0211, 0.0319, 0.0415, ...)

# Prepare the data
input_data_as_numpy_array = np.asarray(input_data)
input_data_reshaped = input_data_as_numpy_array.reshape(1, -1)

# Make prediction
prediction = model.predict(input_data_reshaped)
print("The object is:", "Mine" if prediction[0] == 'M' else "Rock")

Model
The model used in this project is a Logistic Regression classifier, implemented using the scikit-learn library. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, with the model trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.

Results
Training Accuracy: [Include accuracy score from training data]
